# Phenological-State-Modelling-of-Ceratitis-Capitata
A modelling of the phenological stage of pest: an application to the ceratitis capitata.

The aim of this project is to estimate the phenological state of agricultural pests. This project studies the effects of climates and the plant phenology on that of the pests. It specifically looks at the ceratitis capitata pest which attacks citrus trees and aims to predict the growth of new generations of the pest in a 7-day window using sample data which is time-series data.

There are three algorithms to be implemented. The RNN (Recurrent Neural Network), SVM (Support Vector Machine) and LSTM (Long short-term memory).
